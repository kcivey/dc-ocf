      <h1>DC Ward 2 Council Contributions (July 31, 2019, Report)</h1>

        Keith C. Ivey, August 20, 2019
      </div>
      <div class="explanation columns">
        <p>
          I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 2 council candidates for the period
          ending July 31 (including Patrick Kennedy's amended filing).
        </p>
        <p>
          Since all five candidates are seeking to qualify for public campaign financing under the Fair Elections Act,
          contributions all come from individuals and are limited to $50 (except for the candidate and their family,
          who can give up to $2,500). Therefore most of this analysis focuses on the number of contributors rather the
          amount raised, and there's nothing about corporate contributions because the candidates are prohibited from
          taking them.
        </p>
        <p>
          The contributor numbers are interesting because they give a clue about how much support a candidate has.
          There were 11 people who gave to more than 1 candidate, including 1 who gave to 3, 1 who gave to 4,
          and 1 who gave to all 5.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2 id="sec1"><a href="#sec1">Map of DC Contributors</a></h2>
    </div>
    <div class="explanation columns col-xl-4 col-12">
      <p>
        This map shows the locations of all DC contributors. You can display them as individual points color-coded by
        candidate, as clusters, or as a heat map. The colors in the clusters have nothing to do with candidates; they
        just represent the size of the cluster. Similarly, the colors in the heat map just represent the
        concentration of contributors in an area.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few dozen contributors are excluded because they had bad addresses (PO boxes, typos, missing or wrong
        quadrant, and other problems). I fixed a fair number of them manually, since I got a little obsessive,
        but that number isn't too bad out of 1,455 DC addresses total.
      </p>

    </div>
    <div class="explanation columns col-xl-4 col-12">
      <p>
        This table is the only part of the analysis that includes amounts of money raised.
        The first column after the candidate name is the total number of contributions made (which is higher than
        the number of contributors because some people gave more than once).
      </p>
      <p>
        The next three columns are the number of individual contributors in total, the number who live in DC,
        and the number who live in Ward 2.
        There may be a small number of contributors who are double-counted because they gave twice under different
        variations of their name or address, though I did try to standardize addresses to avoid that.
        The next four columns are the amount of money given by those three groups of contributors, plus another
        column for the amount given by the candidate and family members.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next comes a calculation of the total amount the candidate would eventually have once the base grant and
        matching funds (for what's been raised so far) from the Fair Elections Act are included.
        John Fanning has not been certified for the program yet, but I included Fair Elections funds for him
        because he seems to have enough DC contributors (I assume there's a minor problem like bad addresses
        that can be corrected).
        Daniel Hernandez is nowhere near qualifying yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next three columns show the percentage of the money given by DC residents, by Ward 2 residents, and
        by the candidate and family members.
        The last two columns are the mean and median of the contributions (combining all contributions for each
        contributor).
      </p>
      <p>
        Candidate and family contributions are defined for this analysis as those that are not matched and have a
        higher limit.
        Some candidates and family members gave $50 or less and are matched like any other contribution.
        Note that Jordan Grossman's total amount raised will likely drop by $7,666 that he will need to refund
        because OCF changed its interpretation of the law limiting candidate and family contributions.
        It looks like Kishan Putta has 3 contributors who gave $50 twice each, so he may have to refund $150
        (or maybe that's a reporting error, but his total would still be $150 lower).
      </p>
      <p>
        In each column, the lowest number is highlighted in yellow and the highest in blue; which one of those is
        good or bad depends on the column.

          These pie charts show how the contributors were distributed over states and DC wards.
          The bright red slice at the upper right represents Ward 2, and other parts of DC are show in other
          shades of red, while other colors are used for the states.
          Using red for all of DC allows you to see at a glance, for example, that all of John Fanning's
          money comes from people in DC.
          The light gray "Other" slices combine all places that were below 1%.
          You can hover your cursor over a slice or tap it to see what place it represents.
