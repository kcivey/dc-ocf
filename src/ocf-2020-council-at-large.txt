I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the only at-large council candidate
who has filed so far, Markus Batchelor.
His filing covers contributions through October 10.

Since Batchelor is participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, he can
accept contributions up to $100 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
