I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the at-large council candidates
who have filed so far:
<ul>
<li>Markus Batchelor is a Fair Elections candidate running as an independent; his last filing was October 10.</li>
<li>Robert White is an incumbent councilmember running in the Democratic primary; his last filing was December 10.</li>
</ul>

Two candidates will win this contest in the general election.
In all previous elections the Democrat has been in first place by a large margin, so the race is often
thought of as two separate races: the Democratic race, whose winner is determined in the primary, and
the non-Democratic race, which finishes in November.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $100 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions of up to $1,000 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
