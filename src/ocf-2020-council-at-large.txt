I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the at-large council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
  <li>Ed Lazere*</li>
  <li>Marcus Goodwin</li>
  <li>Robert White (incumbent, Democrat)</li>
  <li>Christina Henderson*</li>
  <li>Markus Batchelor*</li>
  <li>Will Merrifield*</li>
  <li>Vincent Orange*</li>
  <li>Jeanné Lewis*</li>
  <li>Mónica Palacio*</li>
  <li>Chander Jayaraman*</li>
  <li>Franklin Garcia*</li>
  <li>Alex Padro</li>
  <li>Marya Pickering (Republican)</li>
  <li>Mario Cristaldo*</li>
  <li>Rick Murphree</li>
  <li>Kathy Henderson</li>
  <li>Michangelo Scruggs</li>
  <li>Claudia Barragan</li>
  <li>Calvin Gurley</li>
  <li>Eric Rogers</li>
</ul>

Candidates marked with asterisks are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.
All candidates have reported contributions through October 10.
White is a Democrat; Pickering is a Republican; the others are independents.

Two candidates will win this contest in the general election.
In all previous elections the Democrat has been in first place by a large margin, so the race is often
thought of as two separate races: the Democratic race, whose winner is determined in the primary, and
the non-Democratic race, which finishes in November.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $100 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions up to $1,000 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
