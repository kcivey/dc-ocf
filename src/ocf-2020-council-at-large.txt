I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the at-large council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
  <li>Robert White (incumbent, Democrat)</li>
  <li>Ed Lazere*</li>
  <li>Christina Henderson*</li>
  <li>Markus Batchelor*</li>
  <li>Chander Jayaraman*</li>
  <li>Will Merrifield*</li>
  <li>Jeanné Lewis*</li>
  <li>Marcus Goodwin</li>
  <li>Franklin Garcia*</li>
  <li>Mónica Palacio*</li>
  <li>Mario Cristaldo*</li>
  <li>Marya Pickering (Republican)</li>
  <li>Eric Rogers</li>
</ul>

Candidates marked with asterisks are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.
All Fair Elections candidates have reported contributions through April 10.
White, Goodwin, and Pickering have reported through March 10.
Rogers has reported only through January 31.
White is a Democrat; Pickering is a Republican; the others are independents.

Two candidates will win this contest in the general election.
In all previous elections the Democrat has been in first place by a large margin, so the race is often
thought of as two separate races: the Democratic race, whose winner is determined in the primary, and
the non-Democratic race, which finishes in November.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $100 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions up to $1,000 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
