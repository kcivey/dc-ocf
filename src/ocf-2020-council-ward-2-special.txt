I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 2 council candidates
for the June 16 special election who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Jordan Grossman</li>
<li>Kishan Putta</li>
<li>John Fanning</li>
<li>Patrick Kennedy</li>
<li>Brooke Pinto</li>
<li>Jack Evans</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats.
All except Brooke Pinto are are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.
The last report for Fair Elections candidates covers contributions through April 10.
Pinto's most recent report is March 10.

Pinto can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of her own money as she wishes.
The others are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
