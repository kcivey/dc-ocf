I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 2 council candidates
for the June 16 special election who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Jordan Grossman</li>
<li>Kishan Putta</li>
</ul>

Both candidates are Democrats, both are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public
campaign funds, and hte last report for both candidates covers contributions through January 31.

Since both candidates are seeking to qualify for public campaign financing under the Fair Elections Act,
contributions all come from individuals and are limited to $50 (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500). Therefore most of this analysis focuses on the number of contributors rather the
amount raised, and there's nothing about corporate contributions because the candidates are prohibited from
taking them.
