I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 2 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Jordan Grossman</li>
<li>Kishan Putta</li>
<li>Patrick Kennedy</li>
<li>Randy Downs (independent)</li>
<li>Brooke Pinto</li>
<li>John Fanning</li>
<li>Mart√≠n Miguel Fernandez (independent)</li>
<li>Jack Evans</li>
<li>Yilin Zhang</li>
<li>Daniel Hernandez</li>
<li>Katherine Venice (Republican)</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats except for Venice, who is a Republican, and Downs and Fernandez, who are independents.
All are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds except for Brooke Pinto.
The last report for all the candidates covers contributions through October 10,
except for Kennedy and Fernandez, who have filed through August 10,
and Downs, whose termination report was filed September 24.

Pinto can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of her own money as she wishes.
The others are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
