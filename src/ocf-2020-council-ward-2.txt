I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 2 council candidates for the period
ending October 10 (Fanning and Zhang have not filed yet).

Since all five candidates are seeking to qualify for public campaign financing under the Fair Elections Act,
contributions all come from individuals and are limited to $50 (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500). Therefore most of this analysis focuses on the number of contributors rather the
amount raised, and there's nothing about corporate contributions because the candidates are prohibited from
taking them.
