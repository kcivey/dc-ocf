I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 2 council candidates for the period
ending December 10. The candidates are
<ul>
<li>John Fanning</li>
<li>Jordan Grossman</li>
<li>Daniel Hernandez</li>
<li>Patrick Kennedy</li>
<li>Kishan Putta</li>
<li>Yilin Zhang</li>
</ul>

Since all six candidates are seeking to qualify for public campaign financing under the Fair Elections Act,
contributions all come from individuals and are limited to $50 (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500). Therefore most of this analysis focuses on the number of contributors rather the
amount raised, and there's nothing about corporate contributions because the candidates are prohibited from
taking them.
