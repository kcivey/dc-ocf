I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 2 council candidates for the period
ending July 31 (including amended filings for Fanning, Grossman, and Kennedy).

Since all five candidates are seeking to qualify for public campaign financing under the Fair Elections Act,
contributions all come from individuals and are limited to $50 (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500). Therefore most of this analysis focuses on the number of contributors rather the
amount raised, and there's nothing about corporate contributions because the candidates are prohibited from
taking them.

The contributor numbers are interesting because they give a clue about how much support a candidate has.
There were 11 people who gave to more than 1 candidate, including 1 who gave to 3, 1 who gave to 4,
and 1 who gave to all 5.

Note that Jordan Grossman's amount to refund results from OCF changing its interpretation of the law
limiting candidate and family contributions.
