I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 4 council candidates for the December
10 filings. The candidates are
<ul>
<li>Renee Bowser</li>
<li>Janeese Lewis George</li>
<li>Brandon Todd (the incumbent)</li>
</ul>

Todd can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of his own money as he wishes.
George and Bowser are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
