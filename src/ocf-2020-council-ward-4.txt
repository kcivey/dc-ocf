I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 4 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Janeese Lewis George</li>
<li>Brandon Todd (the incumbent)</li>
<li>Renee Bowser (no longer in race)</li>
<li>Marlena Edwards</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats.
Todd, George, and Bowser have reported contributions through October 10, and Edwards through March 10.

Todd and Edwards can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
George and Bowser are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
