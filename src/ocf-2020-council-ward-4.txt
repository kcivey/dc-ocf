I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 4 council candidates for the most
recent filings.
Brandon Todd's filing covers contributions through July 31.
Janeese Lewis George recently registered to participate in the Fair Elections public campaign finance
program, so her most recent goes through August 31 (her October 10 report is not yet available).

Todd can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on).
Lewis George can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if she
meets some requirements.
