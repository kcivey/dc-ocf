I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 4 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Brandon Todd (the incumbent)</li>
<li>Janeese Lewis George</li>
<li>Renee Bowser</li>
<li>Marlena Edwards</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats.
George has reported contributions through April 10, Todd and Edwards through March 10, and Bowser
through January 31.

Todd and Edwards can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
George and Bowser are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
