=overall

I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 7 council candidates
Anthony Lorenzo Green and Kelvin Brown (who are seeking to qualify for Fair Elections public campaign finance) and
Veda Rasheed (who is not).
Green's and Brown's most recently filed reports cover contributions through October 10, but Green's includes no new contributions
since the July 31 report.
Rasheed's goes through August 31; I also included contributions to the exploratory committee she
set up before forming a principal campaign committee.

Since Green and Brown are participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, they can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
Rasheed can accept up to $500 from individuals and from corporations and other groups, as well
as put in any amount of her own money.

Green's most recent contributors are missing from the map because of a problem with the DC Master Address
Repository service.

=place

The last part of the ward graph is incorrect because of missing data caused by a problem with the DC Master Address
Repository service.
