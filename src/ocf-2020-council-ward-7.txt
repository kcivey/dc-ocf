I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 7 council candidates
Anthony Lorenzo Green and Kelvin Brown (who are running as Fair Elections candidates) and
Veda Rasheed and Vince Gray (who are not).
Rasheed's contributions also include those made to the exploratory committee she set up before forming a principal
campaign committee.
Vincent Gray is the incumbent councilmember.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions of up to $500 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
