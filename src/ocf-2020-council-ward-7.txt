I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 7 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Vincent Gray (the incumbent)</li>
<li>Anthony Lorenzo Green</li>
<li>Kelvin Brown</li>
<li>Veda Rasheed</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats.
Reports for Gray and Rasheed cover contributions through January 31.
Green and Brown have not yet filed their January 31 reports, so the analysis covers only through December 10 for them.

Rasheed's contributions also include those made to the exploratory committee she set up before forming a principal
campaign committee.

Gray and Rasheed can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
George and Bowser are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
