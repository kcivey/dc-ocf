I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the only Ward 7 council candidates
who has filied so far, Anthony Lorenzo Green.
His most recent filing covers contributions through July 31.

Since Green is participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, he can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
