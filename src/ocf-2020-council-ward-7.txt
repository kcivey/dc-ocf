I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 7 council candidates
Anthony Lorenzo Green and Kelvin Brown (who are seeking to qualify for Fair Elections public campaign finance) and
Veda Rasheed (who is not).
Rasheed contributions also include those made to the exploratory committee she set up before forming a principal
campaign committee.
Green has received an extension for filing his report, so his most recent report is from October 31;
the other two filed on December 10.
Vincent Gray, the incumbent, has not yet filed a campaign finance report because of technical problems with
the OCF website.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions of up to $500 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
