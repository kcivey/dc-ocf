I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Ward 7 council candidates
Anthony Lorenzo Green (who is seeking to qualify for Fair Elections public campaign finance) and
Veda Rasheed (who is not).
Green's most recent filing covers contributions through October 10, but it includes no new contributions
since July 31.
Rasheed's goes through August 31; I also included contributions to the exploratory committee she
set up before forming a principal campaign committee.

Since Green is participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, he can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
Rasheed can accept up to $500 from individuals and from corporations and other groups, as well
as put in any amount of her own money.
