I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 7 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Vincent Gray (the incumbent)</li>
<li>Anthony Lorenzo Green*</li>
<li>Kelvin Brown*</li>
<li>Veda Rasheed</li>
<li>Fria Moore*</li>
<li>Rebecca Morris</li>
</ul>

Candidates marked with asterisks are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.
All the candidates are Democrats.
Gray has reported contributions through October 26;
Green, Brown, and Rasheed through October 10;
Morris through June 10;
and Moore through May 25.

Rasheed's contributions also include those made to the exploratory committee she set up before forming a principal
campaign committee.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money
if they meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions up to $500,
from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on),
and use as much of their own money as they wish.
