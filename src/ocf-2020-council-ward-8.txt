I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 8 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Trayon White (the incumbent)*</li>
<li>Mike Austin*</li>
<li>Stuart Anderson*</li>
<li>Yaida Ford</li>
<li>Christopher Cole*</li>
<li>Danielle Platt*</li>
<li>Richard Campbell</li>
<li>Nelson Jackson Sr</li>
</ul>

Candidates marked with asterisks are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.
All the candidates are Democrats.
White, Platt, and Cole have reported contributions through October 10;
Austin through August 10;
Ford and Jackson through June 10;
Anderson through May 25;
and Campbell through March 10.

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money
if they meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions up to $500,
from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on),
and use as much of their own money as they wish.
