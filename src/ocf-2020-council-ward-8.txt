I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for December 10 for Ward 8 council candidates
Stuart Anderson (who is running as a Fair Elections candidate)
and Richard Campbell (who is not).

Candidates participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program can
accept contributions up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Candidates using the traditional system can accept contributions of up to $500 from
individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in
unlimited amounts of their own money.
