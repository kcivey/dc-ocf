I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 8 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Stuart Anderson</li>
<li>Mike Austin</li>
<li>Richard Campbell</li>
</ul>

All the candidates are Democrats.
Auston's report covers contributions through January 31.
Anderson and Campbell have not yet filed their January 31 reports, so the analysis covers only through December 10 for them.

Campbell can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of his own money as he wishes.
Anderson and Austin are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
