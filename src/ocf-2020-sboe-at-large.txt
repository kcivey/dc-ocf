I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the at-large candidates
for State Board of Education who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Mysiki Valentine</li>
<li>Jacque Patterson</li>
<li>Ravi Perry</li>
<li>Chris Martin</li>
<li>Dorothy Douglas</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Valentine is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
All candidates have reported contributions through October 10.

Patterson, Perry, Martin, and Douglas can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of they own money as they wish.
Valentine is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
