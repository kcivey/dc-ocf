I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 2 candidates
for State Board of Education who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Allister Chang</li>
<li>James Harnett</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Both candidates have reported contributions through September 30.
Both are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.

Harnett and Chang are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
