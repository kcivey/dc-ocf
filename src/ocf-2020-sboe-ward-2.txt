I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 2 candidates
for State Board of Education who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Allister Chang</li>
<li>James Harnett</li>
<li>Sarah Mehrotra</li>
<li>Christopher Etesse</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Harnett and Mehrotra have reported contributions through October 26,
and Chang and Etesse through October 10.
Change and Harnett are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.

Chang and Harnett are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
Mehrotra and Etesse can accept contributions up to $200, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
