I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 7 candidates
for State Board of Education.
The only one who has files so far is Karen Williams, the incumbent.

This race is nonpartisan.
Williams has reported contributions through July 10.

Williams is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
