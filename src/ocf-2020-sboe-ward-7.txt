I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 7 candidates
for State Board of Education who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Dontrell Smith</li>
<li>Eboni-Rose Thompson</li>
<li>Karen Williams</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Smith and Thompson have reported contributions through August 10,
and Williams through August 31.
All are seeking to qualify or have qualified for Fair Elections public campaign funds.

Those participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
