I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 8 candidates for
State Board of Education: Darrell Gaston and Carlene Reid.
Gaston's report covers through October 10; Reid's covers through January 10.

Both are participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, so they can
accept contributions up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meets some requirements.
