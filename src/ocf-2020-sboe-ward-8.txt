=overall

I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the only Ward 8 candidate for
State Board of Education who has filed so far, Darrell Gaston.
His filing covers contributions through October 10.

Since Gaston is participating in the the Fair Elections public campaign finance program, he can
accept contributions up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.

=stats

Gaston seems to have met the Fair Elections requirement of at least $1,000 from at least 50 DC
contributors, so he will likely be eligible for public campaign funds, which are reflected in
the table.
