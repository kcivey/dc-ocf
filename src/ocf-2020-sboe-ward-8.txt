I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 8 candidates
for State Board of Education who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Carlene Reid</li>
<li>Darrell Gaston</li>
<li>LaJoy Johnson Law</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Reid and Law have reported contributions through June 10, and
Gaston through January 31.

Law can accept contributions up to $200, from individuals and from organizations (corporations, LLCs,
PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of her own money as she wishes.
Reid and Gaston are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
