I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the candidates
for shadow representative who have reported so far. In order by number of contributors, they are

<ul>
<li>Oye Owolewa</li>
<li>Dalton Patterson</li>
</ul>

Both candidates are Democrats, and reports for both cover contributions through March 10,

Candidates can accept contributions of up to $2,000 from individuals and from organizations (corporations,
LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in unlimited amounts of their own money.
Candidates for this office are not eligible for the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
