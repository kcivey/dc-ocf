I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for Oye Owolewa, who is the only candidate
for shadow representative who has reported so far.
His report covers through January 31.

Owolewa can accept contributions of up to $2,000 from individuals and from organizations (corporations,
LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in unlimited amounts of his own money.
Candidates for this office are not eligible for the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
