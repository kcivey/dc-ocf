I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the candidates
for shadow senator who have reported so far. In order by number of contributors, they are

<ul>
<li>Paul Strauss (the incumbent, Democrat)</li>
<li>Eleanor Ory (DC Statehood Green)</li>
</ul>

Reports for both candidates cover contributions through March 10,

Candidates can accept contributions of up to $2,000 from individuals and from organizations (corporations,
LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in unlimited amounts of their own money.
Candidates for this office are not eligible for the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
