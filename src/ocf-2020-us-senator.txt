I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the incumbent US senator (shadow senator),
Paul Strauss, who is the only candidate who has filed so far.
His report covers through January 31.

Strauss can accept contributions of up to $2,000 from individuals and from organizations (corporations,
LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on) and can put in unlimited amounts of his own money.
He has given his campaign a $25,000 loan, which is not reflected in this analysis.
Candidates for this office are not eligible for the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
