I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the attorney general candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Kenyan McDuffie (D)</li>
<li>Brian Schwalb (D)</li>
<li>Ryan Jones (D)</li>
<li>Bruce Spiva (D)</li>
</ul>

All candidates but Spiva are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
All have reported contributions through April 10,
except Spiva, who has reported through March 10.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $1500, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $200 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
