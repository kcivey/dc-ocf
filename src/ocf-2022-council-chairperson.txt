I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the council chairperson candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Phil Mendelson (D)</li>
<li>Erin Palmer (D)</li>
</ul>

Palmer is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
Both candidates have reported contributions through December 10,

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $1500, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $200 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
