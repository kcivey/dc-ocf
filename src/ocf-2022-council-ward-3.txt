I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 3 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Mary Cheh (D, incumbent)</li>
<li>David Krucoff (R)</li>
</ul>

Both are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
Both have reported contributions through January 31.

They can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
