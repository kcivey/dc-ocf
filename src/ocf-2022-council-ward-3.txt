I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 3 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Matt Frumin (D)</li>
<li>Monte Monash (D)</li>
<li>Tricia Duncan (D)</li>
<li>Eric Goulet (D)</li>
<li>Beau Finley (D)</li>
<li>Ben Bergmann (D)</li>
<li>Phil Thomas (D)</li>
<li><s>Mary Cheh (D, incumbent)</s></li>
<li>David Krucoff (R)</li>
<li><s>Monika Nemeth (D)</s></li>
<li>Deirdre Brown (D)</li>
</ul>

All candidates except Brown are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program,
All candidates have reported contributions through May 10,
except Brown, who has reported through March 10,
and Nemeth, who has reported through April 10.
Cheh filed her termination report March 21.
Cheh and Nemeth have withdrawn from the race.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
