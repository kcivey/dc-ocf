I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 3 council candidates
who have filed so far.
So far there is only one:
<ul>
<li>Mary Cheh (D, incumbent)</li>
</ul>

Cheh is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
Her most recent report covers contributions through December 10.

Cheh can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and her family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if she
meets some requirements.
