I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 3 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Matt Frumin (D)</li>
<li><s>Eric Goulet (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Monte Monash (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Tricia Duncan (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Ben Bergmann (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Beau Finley (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Phil Thomas (D)</s></li>
<li>David Krucoff (R)</li>
<li><s>Mary Cheh (D, incumbent)</s></li>
<li><s>Deirdre Brown (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Monika Nemeth (D)</s></li>
</ul>

All candidates except Brown are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program,
Frumin and Krucoff have reported contributions through October 31;
Goulet, Finley, and Nemeth through October 10.
Monash filed a termination report on October 26, Bergmann on October 24,
Thomas on July 27, Duncan on June 17,
and Cheh on March 21.
Those struck through in the list are no longer running.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
