I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 5 council candidates
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Zachary Parker (D)</li>
<li>Faith Gibson Hubbard (D)</li>
<li>Gordon Fletcher (D)</li>
<li>Vincent Orange (D)</li>
<li>Gary Johnson (D)</li>
<li>Kathy Henderson (D)</li>
<li><s>Lauren Rogers (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Art Lloyd</s></li>
</ul>

All candidates but Rogers are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
Parker has reported contributions through October 31;
Fletcher, Orange, and Henderson through October 10.
Johnson filed a termination report on October 27,
Hubbard on October 10.
Others have reported less recently.
Those struck through in the list are no longer running.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $500, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
