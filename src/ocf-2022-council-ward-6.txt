I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 6 council candidates
who have filed so far.
There is only one:
<ul>
<li>Charles Allen (D, incumbent)</li>
</ul>

Allen is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
His most recent report covers contributions through June 10.

Allen can accept up to $50 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and his family,
who can give up to $2,500 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if she
meets some requirements.
