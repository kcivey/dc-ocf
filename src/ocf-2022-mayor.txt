I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the candidates for mayor
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Muriel Bowser (D, incumbent)</li>
<li>Robert White (D)</li>
<li>Trayon White (D)</li>
<li>Rodney Grant (independent)</li>
<li>Corren Brown (Statehood Green)</li>
<li><s>Andre Davis (D)</s></li>
<li>Stacia Hall (R)</li>
<li>James Butler (D)</li>
<li><s>Michael Campbell (D)</s></li>
<li>Lori Furstenberg (R)</li>
</ul>

Bowser, both Whites, and Davis are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
All candidates have reported contributions through March 10.
Davis and Campbell have withdrawn from the race.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $2000, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $200 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $5,000 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
