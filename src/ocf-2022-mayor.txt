I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the candidates for mayor
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Muriel Bowser (D, incumbent)</li>
<li><s>Robert White (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Trayon White (D)</s></li>
<li>Rodney Grant (independent)</li>
<li><s>James Butler (D)</s></li>
<li>Stacia Hall (R)</li>
<li><s>Corren Brown (Statehood Green)</s></li>
<li><s>Andre Davis (D)</s></li>
<li>Rhonda Hamilton (independent)</li>
<li><s>Michael Campbell (D)</s></li>
<li><s>Lori Furstenberg (R)</s></li>
</ul>

Bowser, both Whites, and Davis are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
Bowser and Hall have reported contributions through October 31;
Robert White, Grant, and Furstenberg through October 10;
and others less recently.
Those struck through in the list are no longer running.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $2000, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $200 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $5,000 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
