I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the candidates for mayor
who have filed so far.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Muriel Bowser (D, incumbent)</li>
<li>Robert White (D)</li>
<li>James Butler (D)</li>
<li>Rodney Grant (independent)</li>
<li>Corren Brown (Statehood Green)</li>
<li>Michael Campbell (D)</li>
<li>Andre Davis (D)</li>
</ul>

Bowser, White, and Davis are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program.
All candidates have reported contributions through December 10,
except for Butler and Grant, who have reported through July 31.

Candidates not using Fair Elections can accept contributions up to $2000, from individuals and from organizations
(corporations, LLCs, PACs, unions, and so on), and use as much of their own money as they wish.
Fair Elections candidates can accept up to $200 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $5,000 in total), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
