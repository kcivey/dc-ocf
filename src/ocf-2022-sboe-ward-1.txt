I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 1 candidates
for State Board of Education.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Ben Williams</li>
<li><s>Alfonso Way</s></li>
<li><s>Isa Sanchez</s></li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Williams has reported contributions through October 31
and Way through October 10.
Sanchez filed a termination report September 11.
Those struck through in the list are no longer running.

All candidates are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
