I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 3 candidates
for State Board of Education.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Michael Sriqui</li>
<li>Eric Goulet</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
Both candidates have reported contributions through October 31.

Sriqui is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if he
meets some requirements.
