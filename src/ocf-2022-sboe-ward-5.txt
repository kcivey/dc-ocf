I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 5 candidates
for State Board of Education.
In order by number of contributors, they are
<ul>
<li>Robert Henderson</li>
<li>Carisa Stanley Beatty</li>
<li>Nina O'Neill</li>
</ul>

This race is nonpartisan.
All camdidates have reported contributions through October 31.

All candidates are participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if they
meet some requirements.
