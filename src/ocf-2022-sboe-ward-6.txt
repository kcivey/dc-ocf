I analyzed the DC Office of Campaign Finance (OCF) reports for the Ward 6 candidates
for State Board of Education.
The only one who has filed so far is Joshua Wiley.

This race is nonpartisan.
Wiley has reported contributions through June 10.

Wiley is participating in the Fair Elections public campaign finance program
and so can accept up to $20 and only from individuals (except for the candidate and their family,
who can give up to $2,500), but can receive considerable additional funds from public money if she
meets some requirements.
